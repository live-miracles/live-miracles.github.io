Webpage where you can configure a delay for any YouTube

Because of the CORS policy, we can't access the videos with JavaScript directly. That's why a Chrome Extension is required to enable VU meters, lowest quality selection, and other features.

During live translations we often need to sync multiple vMix systems. This script uses vMix API to giv

- Custom Commands: you can remotely increase volume or switching on/off external.
- vMix Web: assign one instance as a master and control other slave instances using vMix-like web interface.
