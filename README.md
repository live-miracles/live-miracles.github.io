Webpage where you can configure a delay for any YouTube

During live translations we often need to sync multiple vMix systems. This script uses vMix API to giv

- Custom Commands: you can remotely increase volume or switching on/off external.
- vMix Web: assign one instance as a master and control other slave instances using vMix-like web interface.
