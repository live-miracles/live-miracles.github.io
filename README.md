Webpage where you can configure a delay for any YouTube
stream, and it will automatically maintain it. It solves the
skipping problem when because of network lag a stream with delay
goes to LIVE, and as a result, participants miss this skipped fragment.

Here you can monitor multiple YouTube, JW, Facebook, and other live broadcasts simultaneously.

It provides usefull features:

- Audio VU meter, which shows audio levels on the right side.
- Sets lowest quality for all playing YouTube videos.
- And others!

## [Gallery Chrome Extension](https://live-miracles.github.io/gallery-ext/)

Because of the CORS policy, we can't access the videos with JavaScript directly. That's why a Chrome Extension is required to enable VU meters, lowest quality selection, and other features.

## [vMix Master](https://live-miracles.github.io/vmix-master/)

During live translations, we sometimes use multiple vMix systems. This web interface allows us to control multiple vMix systems in a master-slave relationship and much more.

- Custom Commands: remotely adjust input volume, turn on/off external devices, etc.
- vMix Web: Provides a web vMix-like interface.
- AudioFade script: this script prevents an abrupt auidio cut during the transitions.
- DurationTimer script: this script will print in a text input how many minutes:seconds of the video is left.
- Slave script: when master switches to the input n, this script will cause the current vMix (slave) to follow and switch to input n.
